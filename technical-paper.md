<h2>MVC Architecture</h2>


- Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a popular software design pattern used to build user interfaces and web applications. 
- It separates an application into three main components: **the model, the view, and the controller**.
- **Model** : The backend that contains all the data logic
- **View** : The frontend or Graphical user interface (GUI)
- **Controller** : The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed

**Controller** : The controller is the component that enables the interconnection between the views and the model so it acts as an intermediary. The controller doesn’t have to worry about handling data logic, it just tells the model what to do. It process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the View to render the final output.

**View** : The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application. It generates a user interface for the user. Views are created by the data which is collected by the model component but these data aren’t taken directly but through the controller. It only interacts with the controller.

**Model** : The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data. It can add or retrieve data from the database. It responds to the controller’s request because the controller can’t interact with the database by itself. The model interacts with the database and gives the required data back to the controller.


<h2>Spring Framework</h2>

Spring Framework is a Java platform that provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications. Spring handles the infrastructure so you can focus on your application.

Spring provides a comprehensive infrastructure for building and deploying applications and offers a wide range of features and tools for solving common problems in Java development, such as **dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, data access, transaction management,** and more.
 - Dependency injection is basically providing the objects that an object needs (its dependencies) instead of having it construct them itself. It's a very useful technique for testing, since it allows dependencies to be mocked or stubbed out.

 - Aspect Oriented Programming is a powerful and flexible programming paradigm that can help developers create more modular, maintainable, and scalable code, and is an important part of the Spring Framework.
<h3>Advantages</h3>


1. **Modularity and Reusability:** Spring provides a modular and highly reusable architecture, allowing developers to create and reuse components, reducing the amount of code needed to build and maintain applications.
2. **Powerful Testing Support:** Spring provides powerful testing support, making it easier to write and maintain unit tests and integration tests for applications.
3. **Security:** Spring provides a comprehensive security framework, making it easier to secure applications and protect against security threats.
4. **Integration with Other Technologies:** Spring can be easily integrated with other popular Java technologies and frameworks, such as Hibernate, JPA, and Apache Struts, allowing developers to build complex applications using a variety of technologies and tools.
